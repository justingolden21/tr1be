			<img class="event-img" src="img/events/dog.png">
			<p>Dogfight – Located in Mira Mesa at Little Miss Brewery, this event was a necessary addition to our lineup as a way for our community to give back to the Veterans that have served and enabled us the ability to nerd out and pursue the life we choose. At TR1BE we have a strong connection and respect for our active duty and veteran gamers and this is our opportunity to give back. Drop by and experience amazing craft beers at an insanely low price with provided food (while supplies last)!</p>

			<h3>In affiliation with <br> RIP WALUIGI</h3>
			<p>R.I.P Waluigi – While we did not create this event, but we made damn sure when the San Diego Melee team expressed they couldn’t maintain the event that it wouldn’t die. The team and community that built this event are truly focused on creating a tournament experience that aligns with our core values and we proudly represent their organization to keep this gem going.</p>

		<h3>Interested in Hosting a Gaming Event?</h3>
		<p>At TR1BE we utilize detailed analytics and research to strategically position events that compliment the local gaming community and contribute something of value that can exist harmoniously. It is our policy that we only work with local businesses and community members that are focused on not only improving their sustainability, but are also attentive to the betterment of the communities they belong to. We communicate directly with other tournament organizers and the local community to ensure a cool concept doesn’t threaten the structure of what already exists. Our infrastructure and events prioritize sustainability and the best interest of the community that attends them. While it may be tempting to just throw together an event because your venue or business has a great space for it, we strongly advise communicating with us or a community ambassador to find the best fit for your prospective tournament.</p>
